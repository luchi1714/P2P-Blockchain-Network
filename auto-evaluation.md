### What works 
- Blockchain and mining blocks 
- Clients  are able to send the ledger to other clients instead of it being distributed to everyone for scalibility . 
- Functional UI
- Addition of clients with unique IP addresses
- Proof of work for verification is functional 
- Protocol codes eg|P| to indicate delivery  works 

### What doesnt work
- Cheese chain has issues updating propely if two clients don't start at the same time. 
- Longest chain in the sequence not considered 
- Every client starts mining immediately there is no configuration to switch to a transactor without being a miner the program.

## comparision of obtained results to  initial objectives

- Initially we aimed at haveing a transactor and a miner haveing the choice to switch mid session but that proved tricky
- we also wanted a UI to make things easier for users which we were able to recieve .

## Time and contribution 

- Guillaume Sacchetti : Cheesechain, Testing, Tracker  (47hrs)
- Sri Kalidindi : Tracker , UI, Handline, Client ( 49hrs)

- Oluchi Ibeneme : Client , Documentation(37 hrs) 


## Good development practise evaluation
- ### Git
For the most part our program is not more than 10 MB in size keeping with the recommendations. 
English was used as the language of expression in every aspect of the process. For the most part 
Descriptive commit messages were used to describe the contribution from each member . Commits were ususally made when a significant 
change was made to the code from someone . 
- ### Code
All of the recommendations were followed in this section.

- ## Testing
